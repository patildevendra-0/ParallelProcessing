        # PROGRAM : 
                        Program is a set of instructions.

        # Instructions : 
                         In computing, an instruction is a single operation executed by a computer's processor (CPU) as part of a program. 
                         Instructions tell the computer what actions to perform and are fundamental building blocks of a program. 
                         Each instruction is a binary code that the CPU can decode and execute.

        # Processor :
                         It executes instructions from programs, performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations 
                         specified by the instructions
